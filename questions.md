# QUESTIONS FOR OC MENTORING SESSION 

==============================
## Project 7
==============================

If everything goes well, I'll be done with all projects by next Wednesday
So no need for a next session ?

	1. Can I be penalized for having used XMLHTTP request
	2. Only step 2 left :
		- do you have documentation for me ?
		- do you have an example project I could refer to ? (send via email)

=============================
## Project 8
=============================
	1. Speak about the requirements together ?
	2. Same as P7, do you have an example project I could refer to ?

==============================
## Project 9
==============================
	1. I finished project 9 entirely

==============================
## ZOOM
==============================

It's not so safe so why use it at all when there are 
so many other better and opensource tools? (like tox, whereby)
