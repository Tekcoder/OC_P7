STEP 1

1. Get user's location with leaflet geoloc [done]
2. Specific color marker on that location  [done]
3. Put focus on user's location 
4. If restaurants aren't visible, don't put them in the menu.
   else show them in the menu
5. When you click on a restaurant, show its google street view photo
6. Show its number of stars and reviews

STEP 2

1. Add a review to existing restaurants / create a form, essentially
2. Create a new restaurant when clicking on the map
[not necessary to keep the info after user leaves the page]

STEP 3

Find an API to retrieve restaurants and reviews! 
Use it to display additional restaurants and reviews 
on your map so you don't have to use only your JSON file.
