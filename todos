2. Put focus on user's location
3. Specific color marker on that location
4. If restaurants aren't visible, don't put them in the menu.
   else show them in the menu
5. When you click on a restaurant, show its google street view photo
6. Show its number of stars and reviews

STEP 2

1. Add a review to existing restaurants
2. Create a new restaurant when click on the map
[not necessary to keep the info after user leaves the page]

Find an API to retrieve restaurants and reviews! 
Use it to display additional restaurants and reviews 
on your map so you don't have to use only your JSON file.
